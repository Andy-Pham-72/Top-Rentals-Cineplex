1,tt10872600,Steven D. Greydanus,Crossover comfort food with a redemptive twist.,1
2,tt10872600,Liz Shannon Miller,"Throughout all of it, the weird and complex history of Spider-Man as a cinematic icon isn't a hindrance to the story; instead, it's an enhancement, using the quirks of the character's legacy as a source of illumination into why he has endured so long.",2
3,tt10872600,Allegra Frank,The movie allows for a surprisingly impactful reappraisal of a long-held Spidey franchise consensus.,3
4,tt10872600,Anupama Chopra,"This film is fan service at its best because even us, casual lovers, can enjoy the ride.",4
5,tt10872600,Damian Levy,"Dafoe and Molina are the scene stealers in the movie, with a special mention to Dafoe for bringing back the terror he gave me at the age of 6.",5
6,tt10872600,Christy Lemire,"This movie's a total blast, but it's also surprisingly emotional at times, too.",6
7,tt10872600,Richard Whittaker,"So often in these big multi-villain events, the hero gets swallowed up, but here he defines the film.",7
8,tt10872600,Oliver Jones,A film destined to be enthusiastically embraced by both old-school web slinger junkies and fans of the multi-film corporate franchise in which he is currently ensnared.,8
9,tt10872600,John Wenzel,"Despite Marvel's usual bloat and a swirling storm of characters, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" earns its joy and sorrow with thematic substance, the breathless action often contrasted with quiet reflection and grief.",9
10,tt10872600,Sandra Hall,"It's a form of breaking the fourth wall, inviting the audience in to share a joke with the actors, and verges on parody. Yet somehow they carry it off without diluting our sense of involvement with Peter and those he loves.",10
11,tt10872600,Wendy Ide,"An overflowing, funnel-web cornucopia of treats for Spider-fans.",11
12,tt10872600,Nicholas Barber,"No Way Home isn't just about looking back at old films. It also opens up new avenues for the Marvel Universe - or the Marvel Multiverse, to be more accurate.",12
13,tt10872600,tt stern-enzi,It feels like the first time that this Peter Parker gets to grow up.,13
14,tt10872600,Clarisse Loughrey,It reaches a point at which the division between sincerity and cynicism doesn't seem to matter much anymore - it will work for the right people. And that is an art in itself.,14
15,tt10872600,Bilge Ebiri,"While the previous Holland films have been mediocre in modest ways, No Way Home feels downright aggressive in its mediocrity...",15
16,tt10872600,Helen O'Hara,"Spider-Man is always best on the back foot, and this film puts him thoroughly through the wringer. But it also gives him room to shine, and packs an emotional punch that could floor any of his villains.",16
17,tt10872600,Peter Travers,"Tom Holland is better than ever in his surprise-packed, third solo outing as a teen hero in a onesie who's out to save the world and a faltering pandemic box office. But this time the generic thrills are tempered with genuine emotion. Good one, Spidey.",17
18,tt10872600,Rafer Guzman,"Short on story, long on insider humor, this Spidey entry marks a sudden drop-off in quality.",18
19,tt10872600,Mark Feeney,"You don't need to have seen any of the previous Spider-Man movies to follow this one. But it's much more entertaining - more affecting, too - if you have.",19
20,tt11466222,Christy Lemire,You've got to admire their commitment to the bit... I laughed quite a bit.,20
21,tt11466222,Max Maller,"Many are the amateur farts these films have kindled, Johnny Knoxville-voiced skull and crutch-crossbone disclaimer be damned. But the franchise’s lasting aesthetic mark is as a movie-shaped slot machine of rapid-fire bits.",21
22,tt11466222,Shannon Keating,"Thank god for Knoxville, Steve-O, and their band of mismatched brothers. Though their bodies might be 20 years older than when they first started putting them through hell and back to entertain us... their inner enfants terribles have yet to grow up.",22
23,tt11466222,David Sims,"Perhaps this really is the last Jackass; regardless, the series has survived so long not just because of the extravagance it conjures, but because of the camaraderie it inspires.",23
24,tt11466222,Alissa Wilkinson,"I stumbled into the night after Jackass Forever with aching cheeks from laughing, a sore derriere from sitting, and a little bit of gratitude to inhabit a planet with people who don’t mind being fools on purpose.",24
25,tt11466222,Simran Hans,"The cumulative effect is strangely heartwarming, a touching insight into 20 years of indestructible male friendship.",25
26,tt11466222,Sara Michelle Fetters,"Is this a great motion picture? No. Of course not. Did watching it make me happy? Yes, to an almost impossible to describe degree.",26
27,tt11466222,Richard Roeper,"While some of the new antics of Johnny Knoxville and crew are hilariously creative, they won’t win over anyone tired of watching the pain.",27
28,tt11466222,Bilge Ebiri,"Jackass Forever is a kinder, gentler Jackass, but thankfully, it’s not a more mature one.",28
29,tt11466222,Kevin Maher,An unwelcome return for idiotic toxicity.,29
30,tt11466222,Kristy Puchko,"Jackass Forever is a celebration of the blurry line between youth and adulthood, and how it's totally worth shtting all over.",30
31,tt11466222,Kimber Myers,"Jackass Forever is at once profoundly stupid and giddily brilliant, with some of the bits here reaching series’ best status.",31
32,tt11466222,Jake Coyle,"What good is a “triple wedgie” if you can’t share it with your pals? It’s a formula that’s been little changed in Jackass since its inception. But, you know. If it ain’t broke.",32
33,tt11466222,Barry Hertz,"I watched a good deal of it while either covering my eyes, gritting my teeth, grimacing so hard that my jaw snapped, yelping in half-mock terror, suppressing the urge to throw up or laughing maniacally.",33
34,tt11466222,Matt Zoller Seitz,The deepest example of the template that the iJackass/i TV series and movie franchise devised and perfected.,34
35,tt11466222,Amy Nicholson,Bones get brittle. The heart muscle remains strong.,35
36,tt11466222,Danny Leigh,"Cackling ringmaster Johnny Knoxville still heads a familiar ragbag, performing a brand of stripped-back, injurious slapstick born of universal questions: how much will this hurt and when will I throw up?",36
37,tt11466222,Joshua Rothkopf,"One day, these guys will be doing these pranks in a retirement home, cameras or no.",37
38,tt11466222,Hau Chu,The stunts are masterfully dumb (and funny as ever).,38
39,tt11466222,Stephanie Zacharek,"It shouldn’t be fun to watch anybody being humiliated. Yet the core Jackass group make it fun, not only by laughing at each other, but by so willingly laughing at themselves.",39
40,tt10223460,Liz Shannon Miller,"Perhaps Marry Me would have been better served by spending less time selling us on the premise, and more time selling us on the characters involved.",40
41,tt10223460,Richard Lawson,"The soundtrack is as safe and smooth as the film. A shame, when both could have been so much louder, and had us on the floor.",41
42,tt10223460,Tim Cogshell,I am so surprised by how much I enjoyed this... An utterly delightful film.,42
43,tt10223460,Brooks Eisenbise,"If you’re coming to the theater as a fan of Lopez’s music and abs, you’ll get a heaping dose of both. But if you want to be swept off your feet, I’d look for something with a bit more heat.",43
44,tt10223460,Sara Michelle Fetters,"This is a smart, character-driven romantic comedy that pulls at the heartstrings with confident flair.",44
45,tt10223460,Max Weiss,"Look, Marry Me is no Notting Hill, the ne plus ultra of “regular schmo dates celebrity” movies. But it gets the job done.",45
46,tt10223460,Randy Myers,"It’ll be hated by cynics, loved by others.",46
47,tt10223460,James Luxford,"There's nothing wrong with an escapist rom-com, but this borrows too much from better films in the genre, and feels like a mash-up of what's come before.",47
48,tt10223460,Richard Brody,"“Marry Me,” directed by Kat Coiro, does more than celebrate its lead actors; it suggests the meaning, the substance, that’s built into their cinematic celebrity.",48
49,tt10223460,Richard Roeper,Nice chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson is drowned out by dopey scenes and shameless product placement.,49
50,tt10223460,Dwight Brown,This Valentine’s Day offering feels like a present that’s been regifted and passed along.,50
51,tt10223460,Wendy Ide,"[A] silly, shallow romcom... thin and predictable...",51
52,tt10223460,Kristy Puchko,"Surprising, sexy, and smart, Marry Me isn't just a charmer, it's one of the best romantic comedies of the last decade.",52
53,tt10223460,James Berardinelli,Marry Me isn’t good enough to transcend the limitations of the genre but it’s a passably enjoyable throwback to the heyday of rom-coms.,53
54,tt10223460,David Sims,Hollywood should recognize the value of this particular nostalgia -- generations of rom-com fans are crying out for it.,54
55,tt10223460,Sandra Hall,"It’s not nearly as sharp as it could be, but it has a lot more charm than the hype suggests.",55
56,tt10223460,Thelma Adams,"This song-filled Valentine is a little Notting Hill, a little Runaway Bride, from a self-aware entertainer famed for the many superstars who’ve shared her life.",56
57,tt10223460,Ty Burr,"Because I have a professional reputation to maintain, I can’t in good conscience give this giant block of halvah more than a two-and-a-half star rating. But I ate the whole thing, and I do not regret it.",57
58,tt10223460,John Anderson,"When a movie has to spend almost two hours trying and failing to justify a ridiculous premise, someone really wanted to get it made. Those watching on Peacock will be wondering who. And why. And how.",58
59,tt10223460,Peter Travers,"Its shameless fluff wrapped in a blanket of bland. You wont believe a word of this romcom knockoff, but JLo and Owen Wilson work real hard to convince you that love is the answer.",59
60,tt12889404,Jason Bailey,"""'Cyrano' is a recommendation with reservation; it gets off to such a rocky start, you may be tempted to bail. Ride it out. Its worth the wait.""",60
61,tt12889404,Tim Cogshell,I like this conceit better... But the best thing here is Peter Dinklage's Cyrano.,61
62,tt12889404,Mark Kermode,"The songs didn't fly, and it felt kind of stagey...",62
63,tt12889404,Cary Darling,"A lush, moving and emotionally rich story of longing, love and acceptance featuring a standout performance from Peter Dinklage who -- as he did in “The Station Agent” way back in 2003 -- proves that he is leading-man material.",63
64,tt12889404,Max Weiss,This Cyrano is a beautiful bummer.,64
65,tt12889404,Scott Tobias,Cyrano is a testament to the durability and malleability of this material. Make it a musical. Make it a comedy. Make it a swashbuckler. Cyrano de Bergerac is hard to screw up.,65
66,tt12889404,Clarisse Loughrey,"A lavish, cut-your-heart-out-and-smack-it-on-the-table musical adaptation of the 1897 play by Edmond Rostand.",66
67,tt12889404,Bob Mondello,"The wind goes out of ""Cyrano"" the musical when the balcony scene fizzles. And it never really recovers, none of which diminishes Dinklage's star power.",67
68,tt12889404,Wendy Ide,"Dinklage is a world-class acting talent who is more than able to hold his own against the rather overegged directing style of Joe Wright, who never saw a frame he didn’t want to fill with jostling extras and livestock.",68
69,tt12889404,Richard Brody,"“Cyrano” is a thuddingly dull film that sinks under the ponderous undigested mass of its own bombast, squandering the talents of a fine cast and a fine concept.",69
70,tt12889404,Johnny Oleksinski,"Every time the characters in “Cyrano” began to sing, I emphatically begged them to stop.",70
71,tt12889404,Tara Brady,"In an ideal world, itll do Greatest Showman box office business. Mind you, in an ideal world, Dinklages forlorn turn would be nominated for an Oscar.",71
72,tt12889404,Jake Wilson,"Plainly we’re in a fantasy world, but the conventions aren’t firmly established enough to allow a smooth transition between the literal and the symbolic.",72
73,tt12889404,Brian Lowry,"Thanks to the cast, Cyrano is worth seeing, either now or later. But it's a relatively modest addition to the title's storied history, one where the music subtracts at least as much as it adds to the story's inherent poetry.",73
74,tt12889404,Robert Daniels,Wrights epic romance is a reminder of how much musicals are geared for grand designs and even grander emotions.,74
75,tt12889404,Bilge Ebiri,It’ll take you right back to high school and college and all those other places where you had your heart shattered into a million pieces.,75
76,tt12889404,Ty Burr,"You won’t come out humming the tunes, because, honestly, there are none. You probably will come out wanting to see Peter Dinklage take the lead in more movies, though, and I hope someone in Hollywood hears you.",76
77,tt12889404,Sheila O'Malley,"Cyrano gets the big things right, and Dinklage embodies it all.",77
78,tt12889404,Joe Morgenstern,"The casting is perfect in concept, and occasionally fulfills its promise, but in a notably imperfect film that’s afflicted by a benumbing score and dreary songs.",78
79,tt12889404,Charlotte O'Sullivan,"Here’s hoping Dinklage and Bennett keep getting cast as romantic leads. Blockbusters need more actors like these two. When treated with respect, Peter and Haley are to die for.",79
80,tt2328678,tt stern-enzi,The idea that it sat this long...I wish it just sat on the shelf a bit longer.,80
81,tt2328678,Claudia Puig,"A very colorful French bonbon with no substance, and it might just give you indigestion.",81
82,tt2328678,Richard Roeper,"The King's Daughter might be more fascinating than the movie itself, which has its moments of campy delights but is eventually sunk by the meandering story, some over-the-top performances and underwhelming special effects.",82
83,tt2328678,Mark Kennedy,"January is often where bad films are stashed, but The King's Daughter isn't just bad, it's a cloying, cliched mess that's not worth even the slightest risk of contacting COVID-19 to see in theaters.",83
84,tt2328678,Sheila O'Malley,It's a vast understatement to say that Vonda McIntyre's book deserved way better treatment than this.,84
85,tt2328678,Charles Bramesco,"Even the worst moments aren't flamboyantly awful enough to earn a full gawk; they play closer to off-key, the clear result of post-production tinkering.",85
86,tt2328678,Rafer Guzman,A generic combination of royal-themed fairy tale and magical fantasy.,86
87,tt2328678,Katie Walsh,"What is obvious is that no amount of time on the shelf or tinkering with the special effects that would have been enough to salvage the hot, chaotic and just plain kooky mess that is ""The King's Daughter.""",87
88,tt2328678,Mick LaSalle,"Even as we know it's dumb, they make us genuinely care.",88
89,tt2328678,James Berardinelli,"Calling a movie a ""fairy tale"" and having Julie Andrews provide ""Once Upon a Time..."" bookend narration are not sufficient reasons to abandon things like intelligent plotting and compelling character development.",89
90,tt2328678,Joe Morgenstern,Instead of The Shape of Water this is a stream of drivel.,90
91,tt2328678,Natalia Winkelman,"Once upon a time, an action-adventure drama began production. Nearly eight years, a title change and a new distribution plan later, the movie finally sees the light of day. Nothing about it feels worth the wait.",91
92,tt9907782,Paul Arendt,"Cursed is no Scream, but it is at least a healthy yelp.",92
93,tt9907782,Marc Savlov,Genre fans and newcomers alike should skip this monstrosity and go rent Ginger Snaps instead.,93
94,tt9907782,Owen Gleiberman,"Makes you long for the days when teenage werewolves were beady-eyed, slavering versions of hairy-palm jokes.",94
95,tt9907782,Ben Kenigsberg,The scariest thing in the movie is a cameo by Scott Baio.,95
96,tt9907782,Stephen Hunter,"The special effects are particularly lame, and an insult to the proud werewolf tradition of An American Werewolf in London or the even better The Howling.",96
97,tt9907782,Peter Howell,The scariest thing about this movie is the incredible waste of once-vital talent.,97
98,tt9907782,Mick LaSalle,"A third-rate effort, with a weak script, cheap-looking effects and no genuine frights.",98
99,tt9907782,Gene Seymour,"How can you not feel affectionate toward a movie that includes a line like, 'I guess there's no such thing as safe sex with a werewolf'?",99
100,tt9907782,Stephen Whitty,"A hodgepodge of false starts and dead ends, and an assault on an audience's patience (as well as on the continuity editor).",100
101,tt9907782,A.O. Scott,"It's not bad enough to make you curse, but you are likely to laugh when you should scream, and to roll your eyes when you are meant to laugh.",101

103,tt9907782,Robert Dominguez,A fangless tale devoid of chills.,103
104,tt9907782,Kevin Crust,The Dawson's Creek sensitivity and unsatisfying effects undermine the lupine anxiety.,104
105,tt9907782,James Berardinelli,Not since primitive stop-motion special effects turned Lon Chaney into the Wolf Man has a movie lycanthrope looked so unconvincing.,105
106,tt9907782,Frank Scheck,Fails to provide either Craven's trademark chills or Williamson's trademark satirical wit.,106
107,tt9907782,Michael Wilmington,"Cursed isn't a very good movie, but it's more an uninspired letdown than a flabbergasting turkey.",107
108,tt9907782,Nick Schager,The best thing that can be said about Cursed is that it's scarier than Teen Wolf Too.,108
109,tt9907782,Roger Moore,"Idiotic movie, even by werewolf standards.",109
110,tt8633464,David Stratton,"Compelling and intriguing, the film continually shifts into unanticipated directions. Farrell gives a particularly fine performance as the increasingly frustrated and thwarted Jake.",110
111,tt8633464,Keith Uhlich,Much too 'Instagram Stories: The Motion Picture' for my taste.,111
112,tt8633464,Adam Kempenaar,The editing - which is also Koganada - offers wonderful elisions and punctuations that add compelling elements and draw you in without changing the gentleness of this film.,112
113,tt8633464,Christy Lemire,"[Director Kogonada] finds a tonal balance that's really difficult between being profound about the nature of existence, but also light and wispy and wistful at the same time.",113
114,tt8633464,Scott Tobias,"Whether Kogonada intended it or not, After Yang plays like a profound film for the glass-half-full atheist, suggesting not only the preciousness and importance of life, but the ways in which it continues after our systems crash.",114
115,tt8633464,Barry Hertz,"[Farrell] treads the waters of wistfulness, compassion and devotion with an elegant ease.",115
116,tt8633464,Richard Brody,"“After Yang” shows how easily the taste for beauty can be tainted, subverted, distorted, and abused by the powers that be.",116
117,tt8633464,Maxwelll Rabb,Director Kogonada’s sophomore film explores a subtly futuristic world where artificial intelligence is commonplace.,117
118,tt8633464,Stephanie Zacharek,"At the end, you may feel you’ve just seen a movie that somehow holds elusive answers to some of the bigger questions in life, even though nothing is spelled out too broadly.",118
119,tt8633464,Richard Roeper,"Thoughtful and nicely unsettling, sci-fi film finds meaning in the memories of an automated companion.",119
120,tt8633464,Nick Schager,Farrell will break your heart...the talented Irishman plays a forlorn father investigating his family’s malfunctioning robot helper in Kogonada’s latest.,120
121,tt8633464,David Fear,"Check the cynicism for a second, however, and you start to realize that the main question here is not, “What does it mean to be human?” or “Do androids dream of electronic afterlives?” but “Why, exactly, am I crying so hard?”",121
122,tt8633464,Alison Willmore,"After Yang is an almost painfully tender movie about the life and death of a robot, but it’s also about what life and death mean to a technological being and a human one.",122
123,tt8633464,Leah Greenblatt,"Like its muse, the movie feels a little like a black-box experiment, one that can be both frustratingly opaque and achingly lovely: a still-waters mystery whose ripples, even up to the last frame, only hint at what lies beneath.",123
124,tt8633464,Joe Morgenstern,"In a tale that touches on such a diversity of subjects -- loneliness, mortality, adoption, family ties, the realm of the senses, artificial intelligence -- it’s the ineffable things that count.",124
125,tt8633464,Jake Coyle,"After Yang may not reach the heights it’s seeking, but it’s easy to respect it for trying to tackle profound questions and reach a register of high-minded reflection.",125
126,tt8633464,Adam Graham,"Whatever the future of filmmaking looks like, Kogonada has a place in it.",126
127,tt8633464,Manohla Dargis,"There’s more to this quest than might appear because along the way Kogonada is upending the noxious stereotype of the “stoic” Asian, a familiar cliché, including in science fiction.",127
128,tt8633464,Richard Whittaker,"After Yang will resonate with anyone who has absorbed such emptiness into themselves, and found some comfort there.",128
129,tt8633464,Mark Feeney,The movie’s like a set of wind chimes with hardly any wind.,129
130,tt14060094,David Stratton,Plenty of fun is provided by trying to spot the local locations where the reckless car chases were filmed.,130
131,tt14060094,Richard Roeper,"They should know the one thing you really don’t want to do is mess with Liam Neeson’s family, because the man has a very particular — Taste in screenplays.",131
132,tt14060094,Thelma Adams,This melancholy actioner with a cliché-ridden script highlights a moral man contemplating retirement as his past catches up with him — along with his achy knee joints and feet. But Neeson’s still got game.,132
133,tt14060094,Bilge Ebiri,"No element of the narrative is presented with the modicum of detail required to make us care... which is a shame, because if you squint really hard you could see the beginnings of an intriguing political thriller in there somewhere.",133
134,tt14060094,Joe Morgenstern,"One could even argue that it’s not a movie at all, only a rusted-out recycling bin of ill-fitting themes, notions, poses, conventions, affectations, tropes, tropelets and inert snippets of dialogue from other movies.",134
135,tt14060094,Glenn Kenny,"The script is, gross opportunism aside, dismally threadbare.",135
136,tt14060094,Robert Abele,"The kind of low-wattage, paint-by-numbers thriller that usually signifies a perilous turn toward the action purgatory that is cheap, direct-to-nowhere fare.",136
137,tt14060094,Jocelyn Noveck,"As for Neeson, what can we say? He could keep doing this ’til he’s 80, but surely there’s something better out there. As the film’s closing song goes, “every story needs a hero.” True. But every hero also needs a story. A better one.",137
138,tt14060094,Amy Nicholson,"The twist in the screenplay is that the story sticks with the point of view of Neesons nave brute, who in an ordinary film would be a no-name heavy offed in the third act. Am I the good guy? he asks. Not really.",138
139,tt14060094,Adam Graham,A by-the-numbers action thriller lacking in both action and thrills.,139

141,tt14060094,James Berardinelli,"It has gotten to the point where February seems incomplete with one of these Neeson paydays. But, my God, have they started to stink.",141
142,tt14060094,Michael O'Sullivan,"For fans of Neeson as action hero, “Blacklight” may be something of a disappointment, at least measuring it against the yardstick of previous thrillers in this particular branch of the actor’s body of work.",142
143,tt14060094,Randy Myers,"To its credit, “Blacklight” is watchable, and unintentionally laughable, but it could have been a lot better.",143
144,tt14060094,Barry Hertz,"You will walk away... with many, many, many questions. The first one being: Can I please have my money and 107 minutes back?",144
145,tt14060094,Craig D. Lindsey,"Neeson has basically become a hero for hire, going through the same old motions in one silly shoot-’em-up after another. We already have one Bruce Willis. We don’t need two.",145
146,tt14060094,Todd Gilchrist,"An unsurprisingly tepid action thriller which extends this odd phase of Neesons career, but the best thing that can probably be said about it is that its not materially worse than most of the others.",146
147,tt14060094,Derek Smith,"Blacklight is a series of repetitious, dialogue-driven scenes capped by an inevitable, and uneventful, action-driven showdown.",147
148,tt14060094,Frank Scheck,"It offers nary a memorable set piece or resonant line of dialogue, except for when Neeson’s character admits at one point, “In hindsight, I suspect I made a poor career choice.”",148
149,tt7740496,Caroline Siede,"Though ""Nightmare Alley"" is too long and meandering to totally work as a cohesive film, theres no doubt it has images that will stick with you none more so than its haunting final shot.",149
150,tt7740496,Isaac Feldberg,"Nightmare Alley feels gorgeously and intricately alive on the screen. Its shadows are luxuriant and deep, often threatening to swallow the characters whole, and the actors play their parts with an aplomb that rivals del Toro’s own.",150
151,tt7740496,Adam Kempenaar,"The genuine, pleasant surprise for me was discovering truly what an unabashed, all-out noir it was. Blanchett's character, the big scheme, the hubris and pushing the scheme too far, the fatalism.",151

591,tt9639470,David Fear,"Wright gives you such a heady, intoxicating recreation of that historical U.K. cultural kaboom that even when he and cowriter Krysty Wilson-Cairns pull the rug out from under viewers, you can still feel the pull of those Sixties sequences.",591
