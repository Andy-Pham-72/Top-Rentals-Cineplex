```
pip install selenium
```

* We also have to find the right chrome driver which is corresponding to your current chrome browser version in your computer which you can find in this [link](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).

* In case you are using different browsers, you can find your proper driver in this [link](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers).
